            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>UC Berkeley</strong><br>
            Attended ‘The Purpose Academy’ (on a full scholarship), a 6-month course by UC Berkeley’s Sutardja Centre for Entrepreneurship and Technology, a program in partnership with 1M1B to spark and accelerate sustainable entrepreneurship by using technology to optimize for impact. The Course was Case-Study oriented and practical, with live online interactions with a small class size (~15). We had regular mentoring sessions with Mark Searle (MBA, Harvard) and Andre Marquis (MBA, UC Berkeley), professors at UC Berkeley and some great ‘fire-side discussions’ with invited guests, one of my favourites being the one with Ralph Guggenheim (Co-founder of Pixar) where we discussed his experience of working alongside Steve Jobs. We then helped small scale businesses in rural India by integrating E-commerce into their business models to revive them from the Covid-recession. We also worked on multiple environment-based projects under the mentorship of Erik Solheim (Ex. Minister of Environment and International Development, Norway, Ex. Executive Director, UN Environment) to accelerate ‘for-profit’ revenues in the environment industry. The program included an immersion at UC Berkeley that was unfortunately cancelled due to Covid. (Dec 2020-June 2021)</p>
            <p><strong>NAFL</strong><br>
            - Took Physics classes for 11th and 12th graders to improve the awareness of interesting problems in pure science and explored Mandelbrot Sets, Fractal dimensions, Vector fields, Lorenz Attractors, Neural Networks for chess algorithms, some Millennium problems, etc. Proceeded to do extensive research and built algorithms to run simulations on the same to recognize trends and plot them (manually), using multi-variable vector-fields and presented to my class. <br>
            - Won and got special mentions in several logic/science-based inter-school competitions including Oxford MUN, Resurgence, KISA, Xavage, Iris, and Scientifica.<br>
            - Co-founder of ‘Ultimatum’, an International inter-School fest for competitions on Entrepreneurship, Technology, Law and Current Affairs. The competition was hosted online, with over 300 participants from multiple countries and top industry professional judges (Including Civil servants, CXO’s of MNCs, Successful Entrepreneurs, Etc) (2021,2022)</p>
            <p><strong>IIT Guwahati</strong><br>
            Research intern in robotics with IIT Guwahati and Wissenquelle for Kinematic Analysis of their ‘SCARA robot’, Gantry Robots, etc with RoboAnalyzer and C-Programming. (Oct 2022-Jan 2023)</p>
            <p><strong>IIT Delhi</strong><br>
            Research intern with IIT Delhi and Onnes Cryogenics to calculate efficiency of Carnot engines and Steam Power Plant efficiency, using MATLAB. Calculated heat transfer in Quasi-Static processes from the Internal Energy Relation. (April 2023-July 2023)</p>
